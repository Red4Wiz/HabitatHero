Habitat Hero

Description:
One of the largest issues in the world is homelessness and shelter insecurity. In African developing countries such as Ethiopia, there are over 150,000 street children, a million in Egypt, and over 250,000 in Kenya. More than 80 million African children lack access to healthy shelter, and 16 million of these children are living on the streets. Habitat Hero is designed to not only educate smaller children on shelter security, but also how to survive if they ever find themselves in that unfortunate situation. Teaching kids the basic knowledge required to build makeshift houses will have a huge impact on them and their families due to the need for homes. The game is kids friendly and contains very simple instructions to play. The aim of the game is to expose the importance to a healthy shelter, and give them the idea to create a makeshift shelter for themselves. The game also shows the difficulties and challenges people face in their everyday lives, and the children will slowly learn to adapth to them. The aim of the game is to help children realize the important effects of an healthy shelter and learn to rise above the challenges they face.
